                <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
<p>Originally born in Orem, Utah, I have moved around many times in my life, and as such have a lot of places where I could call home. However the place I call home most is Moab, as that is where my parents have lived the longest, and where I finished Highschool and served half of my mission as well.
    I loved Moab for its great community, it's the perfect blend of hippies and rednecks, but it is a very united community of "us vs. the tourists." I did cross country there, went hiking a lot, built houses and worked at Arches National Park during my mission, and just loved the small town feel.
    One additonal plus is that you could start at 21$ per hour, with 100$ in tips usually for a 6 hour shift, meaning you earn about 37$ an hour there as a 17 year old kid.

<h1> How I got here, to BYU's TES Program. </h1>
    <p> So, background with schooling. I Originally started at Snow College, working on getting an associates of Science and Engineering, as I have always wanted to be a civil engineer, due to my love of building things.
        After 2.5 years there I graduated with the associates of Science, and transffered here to BYU, to continue getting my Bachelors of Civil Engineering. However, Calc 2 proved to be my blocking point, as that was the one class I needed before I could start my Junior core. After failing it twice, I was feeling less confident. Then during homeless week I was staying at my Uncle, who happened to have another person staying with him, Tizzy
        Tizzy was staying at my uncles as well while she does her student teaching, and I talked with her briefly, and she told me a very small amount about the program, but it was enough to get me interested. I said that if I wasn't going to become an engineer, then I'd either become a teacher or a therapist. When Tizzy told me about this, I thought "Why not get both engineering and teaching?" So I scheduled an appointment with Alyss (The advisor) and switched my major.
    </p>

<h1> Where I am hopefully going. </h1>
    <p> I've always wanted to teach, but I was really inspired by one of my professors at Snow College, so much so that I had planned my life to be a professional engineer for 20 years, then go teach at Snow College.
        Because of the amazing influence and man he was to my life, I still want to go and teach college level classes of engineering, like Statics, Materials and Mechanics, and intro to engineering courses like that. IF that's not as feasable, I may see if I can teach Jr. Highschool or Highschool.
        Somewhat related to my major, and related to my minor, is the hope that I will also get to teach ballroom in the eraly morning to elementary school students.
